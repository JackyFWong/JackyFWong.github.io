    <p>This is an extremely crude implementation of blackjack made in JavaScript 
        for my GC 3400 class at Clemson University. Source code is located 
        <a href="https://github.com/JackyFWong/blackjackjs">here</a>.

    <hr>

    <p>You are playing against one computer opponent. For this game's purposes, ace is 1 point. 
        As usual, face cards count as 10 points. Try to get as close to 21 as possible. 
        There is no "dealer", and you go first.</p>
