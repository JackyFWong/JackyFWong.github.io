    <p>This is an extremely crude implementation of blackjack made in JavaScript 
        for my GC 3400 class at Clemson University. Source code is located 
        <a href="https://github.com/JackyFWong/blackjackjs">here</a>.

    <p>You are playing against one computer opponent. There are modified rules.

        <li>Face cards are 10 points</li>
        <li>There is no dealer</li>
        <li>You always go first</li>
        <li>Only actions are to hit; no doubling, splitting, or surrendering</li>
