# .emph[Introduction to Coding]
### SSEO: Week 4
#### Jacky Wong

---

# Agenda

1. What is code?
2. Why do we code?
3. What does code do in a rocket?
4. What kind of code will we be using?
5. Examples

```python
import json
import sys

# parse a json file for given commands
def parse_file(filepath):
	data = []
	with open(filepath, 'r') as file_obj:
		file_data = json.load(file_obj)

		# conc = concurrent set of commands
		for conc in file_data:
			row = []

			# key being pressed
			if conc["type"] == "key":
				for keys in conc["cmd"]:
					row.append([ keys["dur"], keys["key"] ])
				data.append([ conc["type"], row, conc["num"] ])

			# comment being printed on console
			elif conc["type"] == "comment":
				data.append([conc["type"], conc["cmd"]])

			else:
				sys.exit("invalid input: json error")

	return data
```

What is code? Why do we code? What are the different kinds of code?
What does code do on a rocket?

What kind of code will we be using and why?

We will show some snippets of code and see if you can see what it does.

We will also run some code with you!

(The example code is just for show).

# .emph[What is code?]

???
Ask for what the class thinks code is.

## Why do we code?

???
Again, ask for the class' opinion as to why people write code.

# Intro to Code

### What is code?
Code is made up of 'stuff' people type to tell a computer to do what they want.

Programmers write code, and you will be programmers in a bit!

--

### Why do we code?
Code runs almost everything technology! This includes: a laptop, a phone, the internet, new cars,
a cash register, and of course, rockets!

---

## Different kinds of code

### Websites
- HTML
- PHP

### Software
- C
- .emph[C++]
- Java
- Python

???
Types of code are called different 'languages'.

We will be using C++, a language like C but with more stuff!

## .emph[What does code do in a rocket?]

???
If you already covered this, ask for a reminder, otherwise:

Ask class what they think code does on a rocket.

---

## In a Rocket...
- Aviation electronics (avionics)
- Parachutes, staging, sensors

--

In our rocket, we use an "Arudino" to hold our code and run it when we tell it to.
