## Jacky Wong

Final title name pending.

This is a book I'm writing mostly for myself. It's based in my homebrew D&D 5e
world, in which I hosted a multi-year campaign (now indefinetely-delayed) and a
couple of one-shot adventures. It generally follows 5e mechanics, monsters,
spells, etc., but some parts are reflavored or changed. As such, please do not
expect the events in this book to strictly follow 5e rules. Also, because this
story takes heavy inspiration from D&D, I have no plans to sell it.

The campaign previously mentioned takes place a few years after this book. In
other words, this book is a prequel to the events in the campaign. The main
character in this story was an important late-game NPC in the campaign and a
the main NPC in one of my one-shot adventures.

I have to thank my players for letting me be a DM for the first time and for
helping me build this world.

Inspiration for the story elements, characters, and plot are taken from many
places. Any coincidences are exactly as such, a coincidence.
