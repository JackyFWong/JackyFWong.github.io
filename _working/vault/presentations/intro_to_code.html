				sys.exit("invalid input: json error")

	return data
```

What is code? Why do we code? What are the different kinds of code?
What does code do on a rocket?

What kind of code will we be using and why?

We will show some snippets of code and see if you can see what it does.

(The example code is just for show and is not for any rocket.)

## Why do we code?

???
Again, ask for the class' opinion as to why people write code.

# Intro to Code

### What is code?
Code is made up of 'stuff' people type to tell a computer to do what they want.

You can't touch code with your hands, so it is called .emph[software]. What you 
have build last week is .emph[hardware], because you can actually touch it.

Programmers write code, and you will be programmers in a bit!

--

### Why do we code?
Code runs almost everything technology! This includes: a laptop, a phone, the internet, new cars,
a cash register, and of course, rockets!

---

## Different kinds of code

### Websites
- HTML
- PHP

### Software
- C
- .emph[C++]
- Java
- Python

???
Types of code are called different 'languages'.

We will be using C++, a language like C but newer and with more stuff!

## .emph[What does code do in a rocket?]

???
If you already covered this, ask for a reminder, otherwise:

Ask class what they think code does on a rocket.

---

## In a Rocket...
- Aviation electronics (avionics)
- Parachutes, staging, sensors

--

In our rocket, we use an "Arudino" to hold our code and run it when we tell it to.

.center[<img src="https://openclipart.org/image/2400px/svg_to_png/278039/Arduino-Fixed.png" width="500" height=auto>]

???
An Arduino is a type of small computer used to run code without a bigger computer, like a laptop.

---

## What kind of code will we be using?
.emph[C++], but not really... Arduino uses a changed version of C++.

We are using the Arduino and its coding language because it is easy 
to learn and to use both the hardware and software behind it.


???
Earlier we said that we would be using C++, but the Arduino uses a slightly modified version of C++.
We use Arduinos because they are easy to learn and use.

# Example Time!

---

## Example 1

```cpp
void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
	Serial.print("Hello!");
}
```

???
What does this code do?

(Don't say this yet) Real answer: it prints "Hello!" repeatedly until powered off.

--

This code prints .emph[`Hello!`].

--

### What is the other stuff in the code?

???
This should be a rhetorical question.

---

## The Quick Explanation

This tells the stuff below it to run once.

```cpp
void setup()
```

???
Whenever the Arduino is powered on, it immediately starts running, or 
officially called 'executing'. It executes the stuff held by 'void setup()' 
right away.

--

This tells the stuff below it to run over and over again 
until you power the Arduino off!
```cpp
void loop()
```

.emph[All] Arduino code will have at least these two parts.

???
Then, once that is finished, the Arduino does whatever is in the 'void loop()' 
stuff again and again until you tell it to stop or you turn it off.

All Arduino code will have at least these two parts.

--

```cpp
void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
	Serial.print("Hello!");
}
```
So technically, this prints `Hello!` again and again and again and ...

???
So technically, this prints 'Hello!' until you stop the Arduino.

---

## The Quick Explanation 2

```cpp
void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
	Serial.print("Hello!");
}
```

`Serial.begin(9600)` tells the Arduino where to send communication data.


???
'Serial.begin(9600)' tells the Arduino where to send communication data.

This is like how I give [my friend, whoever else is presenting] my 
phone number. In this case, I am the code, [my friend] is the Arduino, and
9600 is my phone number.

--

`Serial.print(________)` tells the Arduino to print whatever is in the parenthesis.


???
'Serial.print()' tells the Arduino to print what is in the parenthesis using 
the "phone number" we told it earlier!

--

`"Hello!"` is in quotation marks (") because we want the Arduino to print
exactly what is inside those quotation marks.


???
We put "Hello!" in quotation marks because we want the Arduino to print
literally "Hello!". More on what 'no quotation marks' mean in the next example!

--

`{}` just groups whatever is inside of them together.


???
The curly brackets group whatever is inside them together. Otherwise, 
something like 'void setup()' wouldn't know what it has to do or what 
code belongs to it.

--

`;` tells the Arduino when the current line of code stops.


???
The semicolon marks the end of a line of code. You need this for each 
line of code, otherwise the Arduino would tell you that you did something bad.

---

## Example 2

```cpp
void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
	int x = 0;
}

void loop() {
	x = x + 2;
	Serial.println(x);
}

```

???
What does this code do?

(Don't say yet) It declares an integer 'x' as 0. 
Then, it adds 2 to x and prints the result out repeatedly.

--

The code tells the Arduino to print out 
```
2
```
```
4
```
```
6
```
```
8
```
and increasing even numbers until you stop it.

???
The Arduino will print out even numbers starting at 2 until you stop it.

---

## Introducing Variables

.emph[Variables] hold a given type of data. They have many different types!

.emph[`cup`] `mug = coffee;`

.center[<img src="https://gallery.yopriceville.com/var/albums/Free-Clipart-Pictures/Cup_of_Coffee_Clipart.png?m=1434276797" width="550" height=auto>]

???
Variables are like different containers your parents have in the kitchen. 
You have a bottle to hold water, you have a basket for fruit, you have a 
ZipLoc bag to hold a sandwich, and you have a mug for coffee.

Similarly, variables also have different types to hold different types of 
data. You can't put soup on a flat plate, or else you spill it and somebody 
gets angry.

You declare a variable by stating a type in front of its name.

You assign (set) a variable by using 1 equals sign.

---

## Introducing Variables

```cpp
bool
char
double
float
int
long
short
void
```

The Arduino has a lot of different kinds of variables!

???
Arduinos have a lot of variable types, this isn't even all of them!
Here are 3 of them.

--

`bool` is a "boolean".

???
Bool is short for boolean. This type of data holds either 
'true' or 'false'.

--

```cpp
bool x = (1 > 2);
```

???
What is the variable? (It's 'x')

What does x hold? (It's 'false')

You can use parenthesis to group things together.

---

## Introducing Variables

`char` is a "character".

???
Char is short for character. This type of data holds a single letter.

--

```cpp
char k = 'q';
```

???
What is the variable? (It's 'k')

What does k hold? (It's 'q')

When talking about a literal character (not a variable name with a 
type of character), you have to surround it with a single quotation mark (').

---

## Introducing Variables

`int` is an "integer".

???
Int is short for integer. Integer means a whole number, without decimals 
or a fraction. So, an int holds a whole number, positive or negative.

--

```cpp
int g = (3 + 2);
```

???
What is the variable?

What does g hold? (It's 5)

Remember the parenthesis groups stuff together.

---

## Back to Example 2

```cpp
void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
	int x = 0;
}

void loop() {
	x = x + 2;
	Serial.println(x);
}

```

Knowing what we just learned, what does this do?
```cpp
int x = 0;
```

???
This creates an int variable x and set it to 0.

--

And this?
```cpp
x = x + 2;
```

???
This increases x by 2. Since it is inside of 'void loop()', it keeps on
increasing x by 2 until you tell the Arduino to stop.

---

## Example 2

```cpp
void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
	int x = 0;
}

void loop() {
	x = x + 2;
	Serial.println(x);
}

```
This code has
```cpp
Serial.println(x);
```
when our first example has
```cpp
Serial.print("Hello!");
```
What does this mean?

???
(I don't expect the class to know)

This current example, 'Serial.println(x)' prints each number on a new line.
This means that every number will follow each other from up to down.

Previously, our code would have printed "Hello!Hello!Hello!..."

# Any questions?

???
Ok so it seems like this is the end of our presentation. Any questions?

(If you don't know the answer to something, text me @ 843-318-3482. I'll 
try to get back ASAP, but I will be in lab/class.)
