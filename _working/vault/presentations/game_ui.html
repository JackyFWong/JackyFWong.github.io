# .emph[Presentation at Advoco]
## Jacky Wong

---

# Outline

1. Thank you!

???
- Thank you for the opportunity to visit Advoco and for the on-site interview.

--

2. Fit at Advoco
3. UI in Video Games

???
- I will talk briefly about how I think I fit into the Advoco values.
- I will then discuss something I'm tremendously passionate about, UI in video games.

---

# Values

### COUR.emph[A]GEOUS

???
Take steps into problems I've never dealt with before: JavaScript and cooking
--

### .emph[D]RIVEN

???
Finish whatever I started, to the best of my ability
--

### INNO.emph[V]ATIVE

???
Try to think of creative solutions to the problems I face, although I 
sometimes do need to ask for help on this. RockSat-C battery issue

--

### H.emph[O]NEST

???
I would like to think I'm an honest man. I know my strengths (customer 
service) and weaknesses (public speaking). My dad told me to tell the 
truth, even if it's not good news it can be something to learn from.

--

### .emph[C]ONFIDENT

???
I know what I know, and if I think something is right, I will defend it, 
but obviously with an open mind.

--

### KN.emph[O]WLEDGEABLE

???
Going off of that, I'm human and get things wrong but I try to learn 
from those experiences. I also have a good breadth of knowledge 
spanning multiple areas of computing, from software engineering to 
Adobe CC apps and from game design to UX.

## UI in Video Games

---

# Topics

- Combining passions

???
I have had a long-time interest in video games, which was started 
by my friend in 6th grade introducing me to video games.
I've also recently started thinking about purusing UI/UX as a career 
due to classes I've taken. Combining the two naturally leads to 
critiquing an aspect of a hobby.

--

- Good UI
- Bad UI

???
Good UI, what makes good UI, examples.

Bad UI, examples, and improvements.

---

# Why video games? Why UI?

- Getaway from schoolwork

- Fun!


???
Found them fun and as a getaway from schoolwork, as well as a way 
to have fun with friends I couldn't otherwise. As a kid, having so 
many different worlds I could explore and have enjoy my time in at the palm 
of my hands was fascinating and that fascination has not left yet.

--

- Classes

- Linux customization

- Video games


???
As stated previously, I had classes that helped jumpstart my 
interest in UI: Digital Imaging and eMedia, UI/UX.

Started using Linux in freshman year, due to friend's recommendation. 
Enjoyed the experience and wanted to make the experience more 
streamlined for me. Due to Linux's extensive customization options 
regardless of distro, I had the ability to do exactly what I 
wanted. Constantly think about my user experience on my computer.

All games have their own UI, their own way for players to interact 
with the virtual game world. As with antyhing else, there's good 
and bad. The problem is that you are not supposed to notice good 
UI as it makes the experience of playing seamless. Bad UI is 
very noticable and has made me quit playing otherwise decent games.

When I noticed bad UI, I thought of ways to improve it and sometimes 
even went to submit my opinions to the devs. As I was researching 
career options, I realized that I could be the ones actually 
implementing these fixes or even be creating the good UI.

# UI Principles

- Clarity
- Conserve attention
- Direct manipulation
- Progressive disclosure
- Natural next steps

.right[Joshua Porter, Principles of User Interface Design @ bokardo.com]

???
1. what the purpose of the UI is and why the user should care
2. do not litter application with useless information, like ads or overly 
flashy effects
3. mimic real-world interactions to create a feeling of direct control
4. show (only) what is necessary on the screen, give more information 
if need be
5. interactions should be able to be anticipated

---

## Clarity
#### Breath of the Wild

![:img botw main menu, 100%](game_img/botw.jpg)

???
Like most main menus, it is immediately obvious what you can and should 
do. If you want to play, you select and enter Continue or New Game. Change 
options? got to Options. Etc.

Example of minimalism when it is appropriate. Doesn't hurt to look good.
---

## Conserve attention
#### Sudoku

![:img sudouku mobile game, 25%](game_img/sudoku.jpg)

???
Unlike many free phone games, this Sudouku has no distractions in the form 
of ads. Nor does it have any distracting elements like social media, 
a high score, etc. It allows the user to focus directly and exclusively 
on the game.
---

## Direct manipulation
#### Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgtSzSFEkis?mute=1" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

???
Having played VR games, I can tell a good one is the future for gaming, 
exclusively because it allows direct manipulation with the in game objects 
otherwise impossible on a controller/m+kb.

Even in VR, I have not played a game with a better UI than H3. To manipulate 
the weaponry, you just do exactly what is obvious.
- Reload? Grab the old, grab a new one from the waist, then insert.
- Chamber a round? Pull the hammer back.
- ADS? Move your head to the sight.
---

## Progressive disclosure
#### Forza Horizon 4

![:img fh4 game, 100%](game_img/fh4.png)

???
This beautiful game showcases a perfect balance of information, having 
no more than necessary during most time but showing more when necessary.
Allows the user to appreaciate and immerse themselves in the world.

e.g. marking locations on map and world, racing stats, racing lines change 
based on your location
---

## Natural next steps
#### Minecraft

![:img minecraft crafting table, 50%](game_img/minecraft.png)

???
If I wanted to make something, I use a crafting table. Once inside, 
I automatically know the flow of items.

Each small gray box is an item that I have. This suggests that items 
can go on the 3x3 grid. The arrow suggest input/output, and where 
I will recieve the newly crafted item. A book stands for knowledge, 
which will show recipies when toggled.

# Bad UI
## Games can always improve

---

## Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gcPFFpQ5P58?mute=1" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

???
Improve: Increase combo bar size, ally yelling as icons on side, popouts

---

## Skyrim

![:img skyrim skills trees, 100%](game_img/skyrim.png)

???
Improve: Scroll indicator, scroll wheel should rotate through items, 
faster access to individual skills

---

## Warframe (Inventory)

![:img warframe items, 100%](game_img/warframe1.png)

???
Improve: have labels and more distinguishing parts

---

## Warframe (Mods)

![:img warframe mods, 100%](game_img/warframe2.png)

???
Improve: Minimize mod size, add description to stat changes

---

## Warframe (Spacemap)

![:img warframe spacemap, 100%](game_img/warframe3.png)

???
Add icons and goal markers, make it obvious where should someone 
go do something

---

## Warframe (Spacemap Zoomed)

![:img warframe spacemap zoomed, 100%](game_img/warframe4.png)

???
Add icons and goal markers, make it obvious where should someone 
go do something

## Conclusion

???
Today I talked about how I fit into Advoco's values.

I also discussed UI in video games, what makes good UI, and showed both 
good and bad examples of it.
