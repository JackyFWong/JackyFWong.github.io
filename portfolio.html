		<p class="maintext">The code that runs the Clemson University Rocket Engineering rockets. The code is written in Python for the base station 
			(the computer that stays on the ground) and in C++ for the rocket itself (based on Arduino). The team participates in the annual 
			<a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.soundingrocket.org/what-is-irec.html">Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition</a>; 
			we also build smaller rockets for practice and in preparation to build the ones that go compete.

	<h1 class="section"><a href="https://github.com/JackyFWong/platformer-input">platformer-input</a></h1>
		<p class="maintext">My team's submission to CUhackit 2019. Our submission was in two parts: a platormer game created in GameMaker Studio 2 and a program to parse a JSON file and 
			virtualize those inputs to exact outputs; I created the latter.
		</p>
		<p class="maintext">The program is written in Python using the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard">keyboard</a> library to virtualzie 
			the given keyboard input. The input file is written in JSON. This is my first time working heavily with JSON and my first self-built Python program.
		</p>
		<p class="maintext">The accompanying game, created simulaneously during CUhackit 2019, is named Dessert Dash.

	<h1 class="section"><a href="https://github.com/HarrisonHall/pyker">pyker</a></h1>
		<p class="maintext">My team's submission to CUhackit 2018. This is our attempt at creating a terminal-based poker game within the confines of the hackathon's 24 hours. 
		</p>
		<p class="maintext">The game is written in Python (my first experience with it) and took a large collaborative effort between us three students, 
			as we have not had experience with hackathons prior.

	<h1 class="section"><a href="https://youtu.be/LtCW2jCizZ8">Pleasantville trailer</a></h1>
		<p class="maintext">A showcase for my video editing. Created using Hitfilm 4 Express, this parody trailer for the 1998 film "Pleasantville" attempted to present 
			the film incorrectly (action genre instead of drama). Although this trailer does not outline a story, it influences the audience's perception of the film. 
			This was an assignment for ENGL 2150 at Clemson University.
